- `gh-pages` for our hosted site, which includes our analytics tracking code. **Please avoid using this branch.**

# Hyde

The site is built by using Hyde, which is a brazen two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.
